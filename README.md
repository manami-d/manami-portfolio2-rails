# Manami Portfolio 2

This is a project for INCO Academy course to create a personal portfolio website. Any languages or platform was allowed so I chose Ruby on Rails as I am currently learning this framework and wanted to challenge myself to create a website on my own.

## Versions

Ruby 2.7.1
Ruby on Rails 6.1.3.1
